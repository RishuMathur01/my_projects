        <h1>Welcome to Green Basket</h1>
        <p>
          At Green Basket, we believe in making a difference in the way food is produced, distributed, and consumed. 
          We are committed to bridging the gap between local farmers and urban consumers, offering fresh, organic, 
          and sustainably grown produce delivered directly to your doorstep.

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is simple but profound: to provide fresh, healthy, and locally grown food to urban communities 
          while creating a sustainable, fair, and transparent marketplace for farmers. We understand the challenges 
          faced by farmers in accessing larger markets, and we aim to empower them by providing them with the tools 
          and platform they need to reach consumers directly. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Through our platform, we want to reduce food miles, promote the consumption of organic and seasonal produce, 
          and foster a deeper connection between the consumer and the food they eat. We are dedicated to building a 
          community that supports local agriculture, reduces environmental impact, and ensures fair pricing for both 
          farmers and consumers.

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Our vision is to be the leading platform that transforms the way people access and purchase food by creating 
          a more sustainable, equitable, and efficient food system. We envision a future where every consumer has access 
          to healthy, locally grown produce, where farmers are fairly compensated for their hard work, and where local 
          communities thrive.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Green Basket, we want to inspire change at a systemic level. By directly connecting consumers with farmers, 
          we hope to reshape the way food is produced, distributed, and consumed across the globe. Our goal is to build 
          a model that supports not only the local food economy but also the environment, by minimizing food waste, 
          reducing carbon footprints, and promoting eco-friendly farming practices.

        <h2>Our Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Green Basket is more than just an online marketplace. We are a movement towards creating a more sustainable 
          and fair food system. By supporting local farmers, we help reduce the environmental impact of long-distance 
          food transportation, minimize food waste, and promote the consumption of seasonal, fresh, and organic produce.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through our platform, we have seen the transformative power of supporting local businesses. Farmers who once 
          struggled to access larger markets now have a direct line to consumers who value the quality and sustainability 
          of their produce. For consumers, Green Basket offers a convenient way to access fresh, organic food while also 
          supporting a cause they believe in.
